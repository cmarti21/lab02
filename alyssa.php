		<p>I grew up in Victor, New York which is very close to the University of Rochester. Growing up, I really enjoyed soccer and playing sports. I was on the soccer and track teams all the way up until the ninth grade. My mindset changed when I performed in my first musical.</p>

		<p>It was a very unknown, older show called “Man of La Mancha,” and I had a very small part. It was then that I noticed that I was worlds happier performing than playing in sports. I was always in the middle of the pack in sports, not the worst kid but also very far from the best. If I could have a very small part in the show and be more excited about it, I knew I had to make a change.</p>
