		<h1> University </h1>

		<p>I began playing the guitar when I was 9 years old. I received private lessons at my house and the beginning it was a bit frustrating because it takes time until chords actually start to sound properly. Yet, I knew that instrument was meant for me and I never gave up. I play the guitar every single day and there is not a single place that I go without my guitar. It’s not only an instrument but one of the best possible companions. I began playing soccer even earlier, when I was about 7 years old. I think much of my soccer passion came from my dad’s influence, as he is a soccer lover. I play as a forward and I’m currently part of the club soccer team at the University of Rochester. Finally, my last hobby is reading. I’ve always liked to read, but I used to make up a lot of excuses and didn’t end up reading as much as I would have wanted. Therefore, my 2019 new year’s resolution included reading 24 book throughout the year. I made time to read at least 30 minutes every day. I finished my goal about three weeks ago and I’m currently on my 26th book now.  </p>
