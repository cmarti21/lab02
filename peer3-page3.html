		<h1>Early College</h1>

		<p>When I started at the University of Rochester, I knew I wanted to do theatre here as well. It was such an important role for me back in high school, so it was imperative that I found it again. At the Fall Activities Fair, I found a group called ROC Players. They did full-length musical theatre, and it was super interesting because it was completely student-run. I had never done student-run theatre before, so I was excited for the challenge. I signed up to audition, and I was cast in their fall show of “Into the Woods.” It was a very happy moment for me. </p>
