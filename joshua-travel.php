			<h2>Travel</h2>

			<p>	A big interest of mine is travel. I first caught the travel bug the summer after my freshman year when I travelled throughout Israel, Palestine, Vietnam and Thailand for two and a half months. Because it was so amazing, I took the fall of my junior year off (pro tip- you only need seven semesters to graduate from UofR so if you want to do something cool for a semester do it and save on tuition at the same time) to travel alone throughout Georgia (the country, not the state), Nepal, and India for almost five months. Throughout these trips I was able to trek to Everest Base Camp, meet the Dalai Lama, motorbike throughout Vietnamese rice fields, learn about the Israeli/Palestinian conflict first hand, and get lost more times than I can count. TLDR: if you get the chance to travel you should definitely take it.</p>
