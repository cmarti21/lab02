		<h2>Tidbits</h2>

		<p>	What are some tidbits of information about you, Josh, you might ask. Well for one I fenced competitively for over 9 years in both national and international tournaments. When I came to college though I hung up my epee but whenever I’m home for long enough I like to dust it off just for fun. I am also the president of the Undergraduate Philosophy Council (you should check it out on Fridays at 2:15pm in Lattimore 501) which I think is one of the most relaxed clubs on camps because all we do is just meet once a week to eat snacks and talk about cool philosophical topics. My final tidbit is that I have an on campus job as a building manager for the Spurrier/Genesee buildings so if you ever see me sitting at the desk in either of those buildings say hi (or don’t… either way its fine). </p>
