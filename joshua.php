		<p>I am a senior majoring in computer science and philosophy. Ever since my sophomore year when I took Philosophy of Mind (I highly recommend this class) I have been extremely interested in consciousness and concepts like free will and determinism. I pursued this idea more in computer science classes like Artificial Intelligence and Machines and Consciousness. I have taken many other computer science classes throughout the last three years including: 170 (obviously), 172, 173, 214, 252 and 278.  </p>
